## High-levels

### Main theorem

* Assume MPC is known
* Lists properties:
	1. active security
	2. dishonest majority
	3. comp secure
	4. UC
* Lists similar works

### Notation?

### Recap

* Preprocessing -> online

## Technical

### Preliminaries?

* Online phase - how secret shares and MACs are distributed
* Secret shares are homomorphic: goes through construction + correctness
* 



(Note to self: Why threshold?)
