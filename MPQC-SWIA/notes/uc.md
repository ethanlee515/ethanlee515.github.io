# A Simpler Variant of Universally Composable Security for Standard Multiparty Computation

## High level

### What is MPC and why

* States goal
* States properties - privacy, correctness, ...
* Can model (almost) any cryptographic task
	* Feasibility and infeasibility results have broad applicability
	* Like: Very good motivations

### Security definition

* Define ideal world
* Informal real vs ideal worlds

### Recap sequential composition

* Describe hybrid models
* Advantages: Modularity
* Disavantages: No parallel composition

### Recap UC

* High level idea: Adding environment
* Advantages of UC
	* Allows parallel composition
	* Models everything: types of adversary  hybrid models
* Disadvantages
	* Really complex
	* Spends lots of time on how difficult life becomes under UC

### Main goal

* Restrict UC to "typical" MPC situations
* Lists properties - have lots of commonalities to standalone MPC models
* _Like: very well motivated in previous slide_
* Simple-UC implies UC
* _Like: Sells S-UC very well_

### Example of S-UC functionality

### Summary

Sell again - good.
