# Secure Multi-party Quantum Computation with a Dishonest Majority

## Overview

### MPC definition

* Classical setting first
* Each party has input, goal is to compute function
* Goes into "trusted party" and ideal functionality
* Goal is stated as properties; simulator isn't mentioned
* Quantum: takes 20 secs to define

### Theorem statement

...

### History

1. Secret sharing [CGS02]
2. QAS [DNS12]

## Technicals

* Gives a quick rundown on how Clifford code works (about 1 min 45 sec)
* Public authentication test: Gives analysis
* Give subprotocols for computations in enough details for audience to fill in the detail
* T MSP
