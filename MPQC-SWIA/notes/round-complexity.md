# On the Round Complexity of Two-Party Quantum Computation

## High-level

### Introduce "Secure 2-party quantum computations"

* 2 parties that are quantum. Quantum inputs.
* "Goal: Compute..."
* Can send quantum states
* Correctness: ...
* Security: ...
* Yao's oblivious transfer

### Contribution 1

* Yao's reduction, quantum analog
	* Like: Box at the center of the screen

## Technical?

Does not feel hard to follow

### Recap: Garbled circuits

Brings up prior work and says what is there to be improved.
* Define security notions formally - why?
* _Quantum_ garbled circuits - cite
	* Overview of construction

### Construction

* Special case (only one party receives outputs)
* High level idea only
* lists caveats

### Challenges

Why do existing classical solutions not work

### Contribution 2

State again

### Construction

* Not completely "correct" again but shows key ideas
* Refers to paper
	* Ok. "We encourage you to see the paper for that".

### Contribution 3 (!?)

Statements (TODO discussion?)

### Construction

Very high level

## Future works potentials
