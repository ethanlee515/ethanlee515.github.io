# Secure Multi-party Computation with Identifiable Abort

19 min talk?

## High-level

### Describes MPC

* n parties
* private inputs
* wish to perform joint computation
* Ideally we have a trusted party...
* security = ideal vs real

### Brief history

* 80s: feasibility
* 90s: asymptotic efficiency
* 21st century: concrete implementations

### Why SWIA

* (TODO verify) state without proof that abort is unavoidable
* Denial of service
* Describe SWIA informally
* Why SWIA helps

### Listing prior works

* Comparison of many previous results
	* IA and non-IA
	* Which hybrid model
	* Comp or stats security
	* Other interesting highlights
* Lots of text... Why not a table?

### Contributions

This is almost 7 min into the talk.
Spending maybe 2 min on this?

* Main theorems: We construct (the first) ...
* (Finally) mentions adversary model: static and active
* Mentioned "synchronous communication"... Is this needed for us?

## Technicals

This is 9 min in

* Starts with construction
* Shown as pseudocode
* Compares with GMW
* Transitions to puzzle pieces needed

### One-to-many commitments

* **I like this transition**
	* Clearly motivated from the last slide
	* Cleanly defines what's needed
* Shows ideal functionality by picture
* Discusses properties - hiding + binding + agreement
* Prelim: IT signatures
* Construction
