20-25 min?
Try to cover abstract + intro
abstract = 3-4 slides
state result informally

Things to mention:
* Define problem
* Importance?
* Challenge?
* Prior works (and comparisons)
* Novelty?
* Theorem statement
* Future directions?

# High-level

## MPC (SWA)

### Definition

Take from UC presentation?

* n parties
* private inputs
* wish to perform joint comp.

Constant round starts with an illutration of a typical protocol execution.
Maybe try that too?

* Security notion maybe take from constant round presentation too?

### Motivation

Take from UC presentation?

### Quantum?

TODO check other quantum papers to see how is this introduced

When do we talk about prior works?

## SWIA

Take from SWIA presentation...
Try to transition smoothly from SWA

This probably should come after quantum?

## Challenges

_* Remember to clearly define qubit-sending subproblem *_

## Main theorem

Consider constant round presentation?

# Technical

* Don't expect the audience to follow the details.
* Don't even expect our results to be explained cleanly.
* The audience won't be able to reconstruct our solution after the talk.
* Rather, the details should incentive them to read the paper.
* The set of audience shrinks. There are ways to bring them back though.

## Qubit-sending problem

* Clearly define it
* Solve it

## Extending solution to MPQC protocol

TODO think about how to make this illustration possible to follow

# Concluding slide

# Wish list

* Consider modularizing technical components the way our paper does.
* Mention that T state preparation is nontrivial
* Mention constant-round result

# Strategy (?)

go back to our paper?

Goals:
1. let audience learn things
2. sell our results

## On illustrations

* Higher reqs on how well picture is drawn
* Highlights the right places?
* Ciphertext colored background good
* Example of good pictures and text design. Right amount of info.
* Disadvantage of illustration: Too much info => lost audience

## Misc

* When long texts are used, highlight key terms.
