Purpose of things: prepare for later parts of presentation

Don't just start with low level

*optimize*


Constant round presentation advantages
* Good illustrations
* High density of information

# Outline

Maybe can just start quantum?

Introduce quantum later might be more audience-friendly?
Forced to assume audience knows quantum...

Just 1-2 sentences; Full quantum setting. Maybe from the top; don't define classical MPC.

On illustration, just make all icons quantum

Classical SWIA easy because broadcast is possible.
Can just broadcast zk proof to prove every step is honest.

"GMW is SWIA"

Qubit sending - don't need formal definition.
But need to make 


Earlier main theorem is good by default
Maybe main theorem before challenges?

VQFHE isn't prior work. It's technical.

Prior work include DNS too!

Highlight contributions relative to prior work.

Main theorem - Long description can just be changed to "good"

Maybe small animation. Dialog box pointing at it: "round efficient".
Also shows round-efficient is byproduct

Prior work might be better before main theorem.
Only 2 prior works after all.
Can just bring them up informally.

DNS = 2-party
DGJ+ = multiparty

...other MPQC papers...?
Dishonest majority only these 2 though.
DNS10 semihonest
DNS12 malicious

Fully quantum + honest majority = other 3-4 papers.

TODO Need to mention dishonest majority somewhere. Maybe during SWIA?

Qubit sending illustration - can't give good feedback right now. Need to try presenting it to be sure if it's good.

If try to talk about invalid QECC, density *very* high.

Intro was hard to design too. It was geared towards expert reviewers.
Just like how technical intro is supposed to be.

Talks should be targeted to a broader audience.

If can't bring up invalid QECC, then redesign or use a simpler version.

If argument is difficult, it's risky.
Worry: Audience might not understand immediately. So they get lost or give up.

It's at the last 1/3 or 1/4 of the talk though, so losing audience might be ok.

***Make practice talk ASAP***

Can't collapse Auth and VQFHE...
Maybe just VQFHE everywhere?

Qubit sending extends to MPQC

Everybody encs their input. Route to server. Server compute and route back.

Suggestion by chunghao:
We had 9 steps of our protocol.
It's symmetrical.

So far it's difficult to follow...
Maybe 9 step pseudocode...?

Right now presentation doesn't have a clear time flow feeling

9 steps being symmetrical is clean/elegant.
Maybe try to motivate it that way instead?

Suggestion by Dr. Chung again:

Presentation matters. Options:
* 10 slides, 1 steps each.
* 1 slide with all 10 steps.

Might have the same info, but audience will experience it very differently.

Need to be aware of different options so they come into my "search space" for designs.

Human cache memory is very small.
Maybe over 3 steps is too many. Can't remember all steps.
One slide, name all building blocks = better.

Even more high level? Another option is 3-5 steps. Just everyone gives everything to server. Server does computation then send back.

VQFHE can be very high level and informal.
Can do any computation.

When to mention evk is... multiple possibilities.
Again, try it.

VQFHE vs Auth issue - can tolerate some inaccuracy?

Try going top-down
Which code is it... doesn't really matter.
Data format doesn't need to be explained.
Just say "encoded".
Tell everyone we're using VQFHE, but don't say how we use it.
We might do something different if it's an hour long talk.

Common pattern:

How to discuss complicated thing in 20 min

First need to talk about "A". Use lots of slide and still can't cleanly talk about it.

Then try high level instead.

Maybe density increases.

For technical part though, density still can't be as high as we'd like.

Many things are left on high level.

Sometimes there are co-authors who are better at it. Even in a way that others can follow.
Not required if we can't do it, but try.
