SWIA slide - "DGJ, DNS"... "Add 'existing MPQC'"

# Challenges:

"P3..." needs more context

Define fairness

Theorem statement: "We construct a protocol" instead of "there exists"?

# Qubit sending

Instead of E, maybe # Edges... Or define it somehow.

# Our strat

QAS don't abbreviate

Write down the operations

Make clear what "route to server" is

Also define server

Maybe define VQFHE?

Beyond this talk
presented in our paper
is that
how to keygen for VQFHE
