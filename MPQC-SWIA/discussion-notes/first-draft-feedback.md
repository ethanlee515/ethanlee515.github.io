*** Check other talks ***

Goals:
1. let audience learn things
2. sell our results

re-check our paper for motivations to SWIA
Check other presentations for SWIA?

Consider different ways to start/motivate

Make sure SWIA definition is good
Motivated to be highly desirable
then mention quantum

do main theorem (mention efficiency)

Don't mention quantum right off the bat

Impossible to explain cleanly what's our results
Impossible to explain enough so the listeners can reconstruct solution

Goal is to leave an impression so they know our paper is there

First half of the talk shouldn't be technical at all
Over 20 min is fine

If Listener in non-crypto people, still hope they can follow half of it

Each argument has assumption + conclusion
Make sure audience knows those before argument actually happens

Define qubit sending problem more clearly

"Extend" qubit sending to main protocol?
* Add auth
* Compute over auth

Maybe SWA before SWIA?
SWIA is recent?

"Round-efficient" = mention Dakshita's - constant round

Modularize components similar to how our paper does it
