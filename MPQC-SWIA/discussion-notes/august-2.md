Structure still good. Details need more tuning still.

Details is still rough. Not sure what's the meta level comment though?

Highest priority: Slides, still.

Still miss lots of details I should've given

Discussion non-sequiturs

Difficult to follow technical parts as a result.

Too fast, not complete

Literature discussions missing

MPQC intro too brief; not sure what's the point

SWIA: Add citation back on when is it defined

Transition to our result is rough

Discussion was cut off

Routing: Tone's not right so far.
Potentially better strategy: follow main challenge's idea.
Restrict the adversary power to make discussion more effective.

Still missing key argument

Should explain why IA a bit more

ECC = QECC
should also introduce/review interface

For routing, consider paper's tech intro to see what I missed so far.

Define icons...
Colored = protected?

It's possible to make this good.

Chunghao's suggestion

Local suggestions so far

Just looking at slides still doesn't give a complete story

Say more on DoS...?
Just say honest parties might not get output.

Add more logic on slide to illustrate why DoS is bad
If that's necessary to begin with...

Another strategy is to mention DoS on 2nd slide instead...

If something is important, put on the slide even if it's spoken
Ie. define IA on the slide
Incomplete sentence is fine: "IA = Adv is caught" or something like that

Important points here: (Make them **slogens**)
1. IA
2. Why qubit sending is hard

Also say in text that P3 doesn't have enough info
P3: Can't distinguish 2 configurations

See sentences flow too

Rule of thumb: 1 idea per slide

Make main theorem a list instead
See "Multiparty Computation from Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption"

Try making script and slides at the same time.

"outgoing"/"incoming" messages...? Try to clarify. Minor problem though.

Write QECC properties on the slide

Write that we start with complete graph

More facts/observations.
1. Connected = path exists between P1 and P2.
2. One edge removed per packet drop
3. Edges never break between honest parties (implies) if disconnected, honest parties on same CC.

Write all facts on the slides.

Strategies: Just write down more facts

Guess the reader's question. Or ask the questions for them.
Ie. No-go = commit-then-ECC. What is this addressing???

Audience don't have big pictures yet. So unorganized arguments (ie. just two no-go results) won't get through.

Roughness is because things are... just lost. Somehow. :(
