# Constant-round comments

Detailed comments by Dr. Chung when we looked through the [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okBVccbTybI&list=PLduUj3hm1IwBXtlXEszeYHkF5hXyg18mM) together.

TODO these notes are taken quickly during the discussion. Need better format and summarize.

* Details a typical protocol run
* Informal security (like)

* QIP: Maybe should've discussed MPC

* Can't take care of _everyone_
* If something is unimportant, don't spend time on it.
* QIP -> defines OT
* For us, can assume people know MPC.
	* Settings matter though
* Yao slide - two-msg highlight (not historically accurate)
* What's important? And how to bring it out efficiently?
* Highlight SWIA - prep. while discussing MPC
* (garbled circuits - brings tools out as needed)
* Audience assumed to know crypto
* Good illustrations?
* Illustrations - depends on how's it presented.
	* Higher reqs on how well picture is drawn
	* Highlights the right places?
	* Ciphertext colored background good
	* Example of good pictures and text design. Right amount of info.
* Current position: U xA xB = yA
* It's *fast*... would get lost if rewind isn't possible. <u>Can't</u> follow.
* Disadvantage of illustration: Too much info => lost audience
* Being fast is necessary - it's a conference talk at the end of the day
* Details != expected to be followed
* Details = incentivies paper reading
* Shrinking set of audience
	* Start = all?
	* Technical = experts might only get high-levels
* There are good tricks to bring back "lost" audiences
* Online talk: Different strategies?
* Both parties...?
* (Results - Proof) x 3? Very fast; rapid switch between high/low levels
* <u>Really rough</u> proto. sketch; skips a lot of things:
	* guarantees
	* details of components
* Safe strategy:
	* Say less
	* Highlight what's really worth highlighting
* Maybe we should still try to pack more info in though
* Presentation is an NP relation. Try to do a local search.
* Challenge (x, z)... too technical.
* If can't follow result 1, even worse. (Disadvantage)
* If lost at 1st tech, will lose audience for good before 2nd contribution
* For us, routing is probably just "technical" part. We didn't claim that it has independent application.
* Contribution 3:
	* Very technical.
	* Less important anyways.
	* Stated for completeness
	* Try to hit everything?
	* Missing formal/full statement is possible
* Ie. T random sampling test:
	* It's a tech. component.
	* Just mention it's nontrivial is good enough.
	* but worth mentioning still.
* Note that audience attention also drops
* No closing/conclusion was provided?

## Summarize

* Illustrations are very good
* Not many words; easy to follow. Good.
* How it can be improved: could use concluding slide
