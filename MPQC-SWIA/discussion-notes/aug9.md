# MPC

Dishonest majority?

"Security with abort (dishonest majority)"

Can't assume fairness - just say honest parties get no outputs.
Adv gets output or not isn't the point.

Just write "honest parties do not get output"

# SWIA

Just "GMW" is enough, without pronouncing the names

# Qubit sending

2 termination conditions.
Maybe write them on the slide.

# MPQC

"Might have classical communication" = just say they do
~20:00

# Our construction

"Routed" to server?

# QECC then Enc

Homomorphically under repetition code: trasversal; qubit by qubit.

# Summary

Overtime? If not then could've stated properties again...

It's round-efficient and preserves fairness.

# all feedbacks

Overall good

Overtime though.

Remove redundancy and might be good
